# quicksort Benchmark

This benchmark reads a comma-delimited list of integer values from a text file on disk into memory, and then sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) sorting algorithm. Finally, the first 10 and last 10 elements from the sorted list are printed to STDOUT, one element per line.
